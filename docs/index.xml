      <description>This class will involve a lot of coding, for which you will need some basic tools.
 Python and Jupyter notebook A git client A github account  We will discuss these tools in much more detail in class, so don&amp;rsquo;t worry if this is all new and perhaps a bit frightening right now.
Python and Jupyter notebook Python is a free programming language. We will use the distribution called Anaconda as it comes with the most essential for working with data, statistical computing and visualizations.</description>

      <description>Guide to preparations It is necessary that you time preparing for the course. We expect that you have spent 30-50 hours on learning basic Python before we begin teaching. In particular you should do the following (prioritized order):
 Install anaconda and other software Install nbgrader with anaconda (write pip install nbgrader in the terminal/prompt) Open Assignment 0 in Jupyter notebook, see this guide on how to open and use a notebook Work on Assignment 0 - try to solve as much as possible When you get stuck then follow the trouble shooting guidline below - start with a) and move to d)  Assignment 0 In preparation for the course you are expected to hand in an assignment in Python before lectures begin.</description>

      <description>Session 10: Machine learning intro We introduce basic machine learning concepts. We start with the simple machine learning models for classification problems.
Required readings  PML: chapters 1,2 and the following section from chapter 3:  Modeling class probabilities via logistic regression    Session 11: Supervised learning 1 We explain the overfitting problem of modelling. We show one possible solution is regularization of standard linear models.
Required readings  PML: chapter 3, the following sections:  Tackling overfitting via regularization Partitioning a dataset into separate training and test sets   PML: chapter 4, the following sections:  Bringing features onto the same scale Selecting meaningful features    Session 12: Supervised learning 2 We introduce cross validation to gauge overfitting and review the linear model.</description>
