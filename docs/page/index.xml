      <description>Session 10: Machine learning intro We introduce basic machine learning concepts. We start with the simple machine learning models for classification problems.
Required readings  PML: chapters 1,2 and the following section from chapter 3:  Modeling class probabilities via logistic regression    Session 11: Supervised learning 1 We explain the overfitting problem of modelling. We show one possible solution is regularization of standard linear models.
Required readings  PML: chapter 3, the following sections:  Tackling overfitting via regularization Partitioning a dataset into separate training and test sets   PML: chapter 4, the following sections:  Bringing features onto the same scale Selecting meaningful features    Session 12: Supervised learning 2 We introduce cross validation to gauge overfitting and review the linear model.</description>
