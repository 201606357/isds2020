We are wrapping up this foundational course in social data science. We hope that you learned a lot. We want to present some paths to pursue going forward. The following could be of interest:

- We are starting a new masters degree called Social Data Science starting next summer.

- Topics in Social Data Science, the latest version [here](github.com/abjer/tsds) is an obvious choice where we go more into depth with text data and machine learning. We also teaching how to work with networks data.

- Andreas offers the seminar, [Econometrics, Machine Learning and Big Data](https://kurser.ku.dk/course/a%C3%98kk08386u/2019-2020), in the fall with RÃ©mi Piatek.

- For the economists interested in learning about using Python for modelling then you should take a look at [Introduction to programming and numerical analysis for Economists](https://github.com/JeppeDruedahl/NumEcon).

There are multiple courses at the computer science department in University of Copenhagen as well as at Technical University of Denmark, e.g. [natural language processing](http://kurser.ku.dk/course/ndak18000u/2018-2019) and advanced machine learning courses.

Online there are many great resources for looking at deep learning (i.e. extensions of neural networks) and much more.
