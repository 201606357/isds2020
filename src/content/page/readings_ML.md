## Session 10: Machine learning intro

We introduce basic machine learning concepts. We start with the simple machine learning models for classification problems.

#### Required readings

- PML: chapters 1,2 and the following section from chapter 3:
  - Modeling class probabilities via logistic regression

## Session 11: Supervised learning 1

We explain the overfitting problem of modelling. We show one possible solution is regularization of standard linear models.

#### Required readings

- PML: chapter 3, the following sections:
  - Tackling overfitting via regularization
  - Partitioning a dataset into separate training and test sets
- PML: chapter 4, the following sections:
  - Bringing features onto the same scale
  - Selecting meaningful features




## Session 12: Supervised learning 2

We introduce cross validation to gauge overfitting and review the linear model.

#### Required readings

- PML: chapter 6.
- PML: chapter 10, the following sections:
  - Introducing linear regression
  - Implementing an ordinary least squares linear regression model
  - Evaluating the performance of linear regression models
  - Using regularized methods for regression
  - Turning a linear regression model into a curve â€“ polynomial regression


## Session 13: Supervised learning 3

We give an overview of non-linear machine learning models and outline how machine learning tools can be applied in social science.
